# esphome-pace-bms

This is an **ESPHome** component that supports "**paceic**" protocol **version 20 and 25** which is used by seemingly the majority of low-cost rack-mount and wall-mount Lithium Iron (LiFePO4) battery packs (but occasionally a different chemistry as well) manufactured in SE Asia.  The BMS can be communicated with over **RS485** or **RS232** and is manufactured by PACE (or is a clone).  It's used by many, many different manufacturers under different labels and branding.

The protocol is characterized by both requests and responses beginning with a '**~**' (tilde) character followed by two ASCII numbers (usually) either "**20**", "**21**" or "**25**" and ending with a '**\r**' (carriage return) character.  

If you are a developer, the protocol implementation is fully portable with a clean interface in C++ and with no dependencies on ESPHome or any other libraries (it does require C++17 support due to use of `std::optional`, though that could easily be removed).  Feel free to use it for whatever you wish, but a heads-up would be appreciated just so I know what's happening with it :)

# What Is Paceic Protocol Version 20

This protocol version is spoken by older battery packs and has several variants, with firmware customized by individual manufacturers.  Three protocol variants are currently known/supported:
 - **EG4**
 - **PYLON**
 - **SEPLOS**

There is a high likelihood that one of these three version 20 protocol variants implemented by pace_bms will work for version 20 battery packs which are branded by a different manufacturer than the three listed.  I only named them for those manufacturers because I was able to find spec docs under those names - the same firmware / protocol variant may be used by many different brands.  But if you can find a spec doc for a new variant that behaves differently, I can probably add support for that too.  See [here](https://github.com/nkinnan/esphome-pace-bms/tree/main/protocol_documentation/paceic/0x20) for documentation on currently known version 20 protocol variants. 

Different manufacturers will have different BMS management software for version 20 battery packs.  It will not be PbmsTools, but one of a variety of manufacturer-specific affronts to good software design.  If your pack uses PbmsTools it's version 25.

The password for "Qualtech 48100 Test", the BMS management software for EG4 LIFEPOWER4 is "888888".  But there are legitimately some settings you shouldn't mess with - basically most of the stuff under the Config tab, but I wouldn't mess with overriding the firmware upgrade settings either).

These older BMSes will usually have two RS485 ports (looks like an ethernet socket) and may have an RS232 port (looks like a telephone socket).  They usually won't have a CAN bus port.

Example protocol version 20 BMS front-panel:
![EG4 Protocol 20 Front Panel](images/EG4-0x20.webp)

# What Is Paceic Protocol Version 25

This version seems more standardized, with an official protocol specification from PACE itself and a relatively consistent software management interface.  As far as I know, all newer battery packs speaking this protocol version should be supported.  See [here](https://github.com/nkinnan/esphome-pace-bms/tree/main/protocol_documentation/paceic/0x25) for documentation on protocol version 25.

These BMSes speaking paceic version 25 will invariably use PbmsTools for their BMS management software (or a rebadged version of it) which looks like this:

![PbmsTools Screenshot](images/PbmsTools.jpg)

The exact look isn't important, just that the tabs and general layout looks like this.  This is PbmsTools regardless of any specific brand badging or interface tweaks, and indicates that your BMS supports protocol version 25.  

The default password to unlock all settings is "123456" incidentally.  But there are legitimately some settings you shouldn't mess with (I didn't implement those in this component - basically just the calibration stuff under the System Config tab).

These BMSes will typically have two or three RS485 ports (looks like an ethernet socket) an RS232 port (looks like a telephone socket) and possibly a CAN bus port and an LCD display as well, especially if newer.

![Jakiper Protocol 25 Front Panel](images/Jakiper-0x25.png)

# What Is Pace MODBUS Protocol

Some BMS firmwares also support reading data via MODBUS protocol over the RS485 port.  I haven't looked into this yet.  It seems like it may co-exist with Paceic version 25.  Documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/nkinnan/esphome-pace-bms/tree/main/protocol_documentation/modbus).  I may add support for this later, but since documentation is available, ESPHome already has native support for MODBUS, and syssi has already created an [ESPHome configuration for it](https://github.com/syssi/esphome-pace-bms), it's low priority.

# Supported BMS Configuration (read / write) - **Protocol Version 25 ONLY**

It is difficult to find good documentation on either of these protocols.  All the references I have are incomplete.  For version 25 I was able to snoop on the exchanges between PbmsTools and my battery pack in order to decode all of the commands necessary for setting these configuration values.  However, the only battery pack I own which speaks version 20, is sending some very strange non-paceic commands for configuration settings.  Unfortunately I was unable to decode those, and even if I did, I'm not sure if it would apply to all brands of battery pack speaking version 20.  For that reason, I didn't pursue it further, and these settings are only applicable to battery packs speaking paceic version 25.

# What Battery Packs are Supported?

**As far as I know, many/most.**  Any not listed should simply require a slightly different configuration (or might re-use one of the existing ones).  

However, I'd like to keep a full list here if only for search engine discoverability, so if you find that it does work with your battery pack, please contact me with the configuration settings required, the make/model of battery pack (and a link to the exact model on the manufacturer's website if possible), and what it reports for the hardware version.

**If not listed**, for help figuring out the required settings to get your battery pack working, see [How to configure a battery pack that's not in the supported list (yet)](#how-to-configure-a-battery-pack-thats-not-in-the-supported-list-yet)

  - notes:
    - Although the protocol documentation I have is labeled EG4, the BMS is manufactured by [Qualtech](http://qualtech.com.cn/en/).  Any battery pack using the same BMS would be supported.
    - The BMS is a bit slow, so don't reduce the timeouts too much. I have found the following settings prevent lockup from querying it too quickly:
      - `request_throttle: 200ms`
      - `response_timeout: 2000ms`

# What ESPs and RPs are Supported?

Both ESP8266 and ESP32 are supported, though an ESP32 class device is recommended.  The RP2040 (Raspberry Pi Pico W) should also work but I haven't tested it.

Any board which gives you access to a hardware UART (both RX and TX) is fine.  Software UART on GPIO pins is not recommended.  

You cannot connect the UART RX/TX pins directly to either the RS232 or RS485 port, a converter chip for RS485 or RS232 signal levels is required.  Some boards may have such a converter chip built-in, or you can use a breakout board.  

RS485 will require at least one additional GPIO pin for flow control in addition to the UART RX and TX pins.  RS232 will require only the UART RX and TX.

If using an 8266, you will need to redirect serial logs to the second UART (which is TX only, but that's fine for logging).  An example of how to do that is included below in the [YAML section](#8266-specific-preamble).

# How do I wire my ESP to the RS485 port?

You will need a converter chip.  I have had success with the MAX485.  It's designed for 5v but I've had no issues using it at 3.3v with an ESP.  [Here](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00NIOLNAG) is an example breakout board for the MAX485 chip.  You may be able to find ESP boards with such a chip already integrated.

![MAX485 Breakout Board](images/max485.jpg)

This example breakout board separates out the flow control pins **DE** and **RÌEÌ**, but they need to be tied together which you can do by either bridging the solder blobs on the back of the pins, or otherwise wiring both pins together.  

Connect the breakout board to the **ESP**:
* **DI** (driver input) **->** ESP UART **TX** 
* **RO** (receiver output) **->** ESP UART **RX**
* **DE** (Driver Output Enable) and **RÌEÌ** (Receiver Output Enable, active low) -> any ESP **GPIO**, from here out referred to as "the **Flow Control** pin"

Connect the breakout board to the **BMS**:
* **A** aka **D+** -> pin / blade **7** (white with a brown stripe if using ethernet cabling)
* **B** aka **D-** -> pin / blade **8** (solid brown if using ethernet cabling)

![RJ-45 Socket and Connector with Pin Numbers and Color Codes](images/rj45.png)

Lastly, don't forget to connect power (3.3v) and ground to the breakout board.

# How do I wire my ESP to the RS232 port?

You will need a converter chip.  I have had success with the SP232.  It's compatible with the ESP 3.3v power and signaling levels.  [Here](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B091TN2ZPY) is an example breakout board for the SP232 chip.  You may be able to find ESP boards with such a chip already integrated.

![SP232 Breakout Board](images/sp232.jpg)

Connect the breakout board to the **ESP**:
* TTL **RXD** **->** ESP UART **TX**
* TTL **TXD** **->** ESP UART **RX** 

Connect the breakout board to the **BMS**:
* RS232 **RXD** -> pin / blade **3** 
* RS232 **TXD** -> pin / blade **4** 
* RS232 **GND** -> pin / blade **5** 

**DON'T TRUST THE COLOR CODES** in this diagram, telephone cables are "straight through" and colors will be "mirrored" between the two ends of an extension cord.  Plus the wire colors aren't always standard.  **Use the pin/blade numbering** from the diagram for wiring the proper connections.  

Note that pin/blade **1 and 6 are usually left blank** but **STILL COUNT** for numbering!  

If cutting up a telephone extension cord, make sure it's "**dual line**" / has four wires and not just two.

![RJ-11 Socket and Connector with Pin Numbers and Color Codes](images/rj11.png)

Lastly, don't forget to connect power (3.3v) and ground to the breakout board.

# ESPHome configuration YAML

A full ESPHome configuration will consist of thee parts:

1. The basic stuff like board type, wifi credentials, api or mqtt configuration, web_server if used, and so on. 
3. Configuration of the UART and the pace_bms component to speak with your battery pack.
4. Exposing the sensors / configuration values that you want accessible via the web_server dashboard, homeassistant, or mqtt.

I won't go over 1 since that will be specific to your setup, except to say that if you want to use `web_server` then you should probably add `version: 3` and click the dark mode icon whenever you open it up.  It is a *significant* improvement over version 2, but not yet set as the default, and some of the color choices indicate it was designed in dark mode since they don't work as well with a white background - mainly the logging colors.

## A note on logging

While initially setting up this component, I'd strongly recommend setting log level to VERY_VERBOSE.  You can reduce that back to INFO or higher once you confirm everything is working.  If you want to submit logs on an issue report, please gather them with log level VERY_VERBOSE as that will include the actual strings sent to/from the BMS over the UART.  You might want to remove many/most of the sensors when running at the VERY_VERBOSE level however, as a sensors publishing new values generates a **lot** of log output, and it's mainly the component logs that are important, not the sensor logs.

```yaml
logger:
  #level: INFO
  #level: DEBUG
  #level: VERBOSE
  level: VERY_VERBOSE
```
Additionally, if you want to get serial logs over USB on a C3, S2 or S3, you should add this to your logger config:

```yaml
logger:
  # needed for C3, S2 and S3 (and possibly others) to read logs via USB, depending on framework used
  hardware_uart: USB_CDC 
```

## 8266-specific preamble

1) If using an 8266 in conjunction with web_server, you will want to add this to your esphome config.  It **massively** speeds up how quickly the 8266 can speak with the web_server dashboard by correcting a bug in the web server code.  Once [this PR](https://github.com/esphome/ESPAsyncWebServer/pull/41) goes through these lines can be removed.
```yaml
esphome:
  libraries:
    # massive improvement to event throughput to the on-device web_server dashboard
    # can be removed once this PR goes through: https://github.com/esphome/ESPAsyncWebServer/pull/41
    # but the web_server dashboard is basically useless on an 8266 without it
    - ESPAsyncWebServer-esphome=https://github.com/nkinnan/ESPAsyncWebServer#async_event_source_yield
```
2) Since an 8266 only has 1.5 UARTs (a full UART 0 with rx+tx and half of a UART 1 with tx only) we need to redirect log output to UART 1 so we can fully utilize UART 0 for communication with the BMS.  You can do that like so:
```yaml
logger:
  hardware_uart: UART1 # using UART0 for BMS communications
```

## external_components

Before anything else, you will need to tell ESPHome where to find this component.  Add the following lines to your YAML:

```yaml
external_components:
  - source:
      type: git
      url: https://github.com/nkinnan/esphome-pace-bms
      ref: "main"
    components: [ pace_bms ]
    refresh: 1s
```
If you're exposing the BMS date/time sensor you might also need to include this:
```yaml
external_components:
  - source:
      type: git
      url: https://github.com/nkinnan/esphome
      ref: "make_time_dependency_optional"
    components: [ datetime ]
    refresh: 1s
```

This second source section is needed to work around a design bug in the ESPHome DateTime component, it will be removed / become unnecessary once [the PR](https://github.com/esphome/esphome/pull/7425) to fix that goes through.

## UART and pace_bms

Next, lets configure the UART and pace_bms component to speak with your BMS.

```yaml
uart:
  id: uart_0
  baud_rate: 9600 
  tx_pin: GPIO2
  rx_pin: GPIO1
  rx_buffer_size: 256
```
* **baud_rate:** The most common value for baud_rate is 9600, but some BMSes are reported to use 19200 as well.  You should know what this value is from previously communicating with the BMS using the manufacturer's recommended software.
* **tx_pin / rx_pin:** Self-explanatory, see previous sections on wiring your ESP to the RS232 or RS485 port. 
* **rx_buffer_size:** A minimum size of 256 is required for this component to function reliably.
```yaml
pace_bms:
  id: pace_bms_at_address_1
  address: 1
  uart_id: uart_0
  flow_control_pin: GPIO0 
  update_interval: 5s
  request_throttle: 200ms # can be reduced to 50ms for protocol 25
  response_timeout: 2000ms # can be reduced to 1000ms for protocol 25

  protocol_commandset: 0x20 # example only
  protocol_variant: "EG4"   # example only
  protocol_version: 0x20    # example only
  battery_chemistry: 0x4A   # example only
```
* **address:** This is the address of your BMS, set with the DIP switches on the front next to the RS232 and RS485 ports.  **Important:** If you change the value of the DIP switches, you'll need to reset the BMS for the new address to take effect.  Either by flipping the breaker, or using something like a toothpick or push-pin to depress the recessed reset button.  The most common address values are 0 and 1, unless your battery packs are daisy chained, which is not currently supported by this component.
* **uart_id:** The ID of the UART you configured.  This component currently requires one UART per BMS, though I'm considering a design change that would allow it to read "daisy chained" BMSes in the future.
* **flow_control_pin:** If using RS232 this setting should be omitted.  If using RS485, this is required to be set, as it controls the direction of communication on the RS485 bus.  It should be connected to *both* the **DE** (Driver Output Enable) and **RÌEÌ** (Receiver Output Enable, active low) pins on the RS485 adapter / breakout board.
* **update_interval:** How often to query the BMS and publish whatever updated values are read back.  What queries are sent to the BMS is determined by what values you have requested to be published in [the rest of your configuration](#Exposing-the-sensors-this-is-the-good-part).
* **request_throttle:** Minimum interval between sending requests to the BMS.  Increasing this may help if your BMS "locks up" after a while, it's probably getting overwhelmed.
* **response_timeout:** Maximum time to wait for a response before "giving up" and sending the next.  Increasing this may help if your BMS "locks up" after a while, it's probably getting overwhelmed.
* **protocol_commandset, protocol_variant, protocol_version,** and **battery_chemistry:** 
   - Consider these as a set.  Use values from the [known supported list](#What-Battery-Packs-are-Supported), or determine them manually by following the steps in [How to configure a battery pack that's not in the supported list (yet)](#how-to-configure-a-battery-pack-thats-not-in-the-supported-list-yet)

## Example Config Files

If you already have a config for your board, you should use that, and then copy/paste/modify the relevant parts of [ESPHome configuration YAML](#ESPHome-configuration-YAML).  You'll need to read that anyway to understand what these files contain.  But here are some basic configs if starting from scratch.  The main difference between them is just the board declaration (and the 8266-specific settings as noted in [8266-specific preamble](#8266-specific-preamble))

### Protocol 25

# How to configure a battery pack that's not in the supported list (yet)

Before proceeding through this section, please read the entire rest of this document first!  It assumes some familiarity and does not repeat steps like configuring the UART, but simply provides a guide on how to determine the specific protocol your BMS is speaking.

If your battery pack has a front panel that "looks like" a Pace BMS but is not in the "known supported" list, it probably is, and is probably supported.  Unless there are more version 20 variants out there than I've guessed, but even then you should be able to get some useful data back.  So you just need to figure out what settings will enable this component to speak with it.

Step 0 (shortcut): Just try protocol version 25 with defaults
-
This is the version "spoken" by (I believe) the majority of packs sold today.   You can short circuit any extra steps by simply trying this:

```yaml
pace_bms:
  <...etc...>
  protocol_commandset: 0x25

text_sensor:
  - platform: pace_bms
    pace_bms_id: pace_bms_at_address_1

    hardware_version:
      name: "Hardware Version"
    serial_number:
      name: "Serial Number"
```

If you get reasonable values back for the two text sensors, you're basically done.  Just fill out your YAML with [the rest of the settings / readouts you want exposed](#Exposing-the-sensors-this-is-the-good-part) and you can skip the rest of this section.  Please contact me with your make/model/hardware version as well as the settings you used so that I can add it to the known supported list.

If it didn't work, no worries, continue reading.

Step 1: Is the BMS speaking paceic?
-
The first step is to make sure it's communicating at all.  If you can't connect the battery manufacturer's BMS software to it and get readings back, don't proceed any further until you can.  There's no point trying to debug a dead port or a broken BMS.  You can try both RS232 and RS485.  One or the other may not be "active".  The RS232 port if available is the most likely to be speaking paceic (different ports may be configured to speak different protocols).  

Once your manufacturer's recommended software is talking to your battery pack successfully, if you're on Windows, you can use [this software](https://www.com-port-monitoring.com/downloads.html) to "snoop" on the COM port and see what the protocol looks like.  Linux or Mac should have equivalents available but I'm not familiar with them.  You should see something like this (make sure you're in "text" mode):

```~25xx46xxxxxxxxxx\r```
or
```~20xx46xxxxxxxxxx\r```

The values may be slightly different.  The x's will be hexidecimal numbers (in fact, all values are ASCII text hexidecimal).  The \r may or may not be visible, it might just show up as a line return in whatever software you're using to snoop on the COM port.  If it looks nothing like that at all, sorry, you're out of luck.  If some of the requests look like that and other's don't, that's fine.  Continue on as long as at least some of them do.

Step 2: Understanding what we need
-
We need at least one and as many as four configuration values to speak with the BMS successfully:
1) **`protocol_commandset`** - The **actual** protocol version being used, this determines what commands can be sent to the BMS.
2) **`protocol_version`** - The "claimed" version of the protocol - some BMSes lie about what protocol version they are speaking in order to lock you into an ecosystem.  This is the value sent over the wire in the frame header, but which commands can be sent is still determined by `protocol_commandset`
3) **`protocol_variant`** - For protocol commandset 20 only, the "variant" of the protocol this BMS is using.  This determines how some of the BMS responses (to the same command) are interpreted, and can be one of (currently) three supported values:
    * PYLON
    * SEPLOS
    * EG4

    Protocol 25 has no variants I am aware of.
4) **`battery_chemistry`** - In almost all cases this will be 0x46, but some manufacturers who intentionally break compatibility will use a different value (or actually legitimately have a different chemistry in some cases).

Step 3: the commandset
-
Now, going back to the requests you snooped over the COM port
```
~25xx46xxxxxxxxxx\r
```
The first number, the 20 or the 25 at the beginning (it may be a different number, more on that in a moment) is the protocol version your BMS is speaking.  The second number (after two other hexidecimal values shown as x's) is your battery chemistry.  Put both of them into your config YAML (you can skip battery_chemistry if it was 46 as expected since that is the default value).  

Note that the "0x" prefix just means "this value is hexidecimal":
 

```yaml
pace_bms:
  protocol_commandset: 0x20
  battery_chemistry: 0x4A # only if not 46
```
or
```yaml
pace_bms:
  protocol_commandset: 0x25
  battery_chemistry: 0x4A # only if not 46
```  

If your commandset value is 0x25 then you're basically done.  Just fill out your YAML with [the rest of the settings / readouts you want exposed](#Exposing-the-sensors-this-is-the-good-part) and you can skip the rest of this section.  Please contact me with your make/model/hardware version as well as the settings you used so that I can add it to the known supported list.

Step 4: If the BMS is lying
-
If the requests you were seeing started with either **20 or 25, skip this step**.

If the requests you were seeing *didn't* start with either 20 or 25, but otherwise "looked right", that means your BMS is using a custom firmware with a non-standard protocol version reported.  That's probably fine, it's probably still speaking version 20 or 25, but is lying about it because some manufacturers intentionally break compatibility, presumably because they want to lock you into their ecosystem.  So you're going to have to try both, and configure pace_bms to lie right back.  Here we'll use 42 as an example of that first number you saw instead of a 20 or 25. 

```yaml
pace_bms:
  protocol_commandset: 0x20
  battery_chemistry: 0x4A # only if not 46
  protocol_version: 0x42 # the BMS is lying, so lie right back
```
or

```yaml
pace_bms:
  protocol_commandset: 0x25
  battery_chemistry: 0x4A # only if not 46
  protocol_version: 0x42 # the BMS is lying, so lie right back
```

If you had to guess which commandset like this, you can figure out if it is "truly" 0x20 or 0x25 simply by seeing if pace_bms starts logging errors or returns good data.  I suggest trying to read these two values first, since there is some overlap between the protocol versions for the analog and status values - so it may not be obvious at first if the data returned is wrong or not.  If the BMS responds to either of these with something intelligible, you have probably picked the correct commandset value.  But keep an eye on the logs for errors and warnings.

```yaml
text_sensor:
  - platform: pace_bms
    pace_bms_id: pace_bms_at_address_1

    hardware_version:
      name: "Hardware Version"
    serial_number:
      name: "Serial Number"
```

Once again, if your "true" commandset value is determined to be 0x25 then you're basically done.  Just fill out your YAML with [the rest of the settings / readouts you want exposed](#Exposing-the-sensors-this-is-the-good-part) and you can skip the rest of this section.  Please contact me with your make/model/hardware version as well as the settings you used so that I can add it to the known supported list.

Step 5: An extra step for commandset 20
-
If you determined the commandset to be 0x20 then you also need to figure out which "variant" of protocol version 20 it is.  Start by putting this into your config:

```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: pace_bms
    pace_bms_id: pace_bms_at_address_1
    
    cell_count:
      name: "Cell Count"

text_sensor:
  - platform: pace_bms
    pace_bms_id: pace_bms_at_address_1

    system_status:
      name: "System Status"
```

This will cause both the "analog information" and "status  information" requests to be sent to the BMS, the results of which contain telltales which pace_bms will sniff out to determine which version 20 protocol variant your BMS is speaking.  

You should see lines like this in the logs, they will be highlighted **green**:  

```[20:08:57][I][pace_bms_protocol:028]: Detected protocol variant: EG4```

Alternatively you may see lines like this instead, highlighted in **yellow**:

```[20:08:57][I][pace_bms_protocol:028]: Protocol variant not configured, unable to auto-detect, defaulting to EG4```

If you got the line highlighted in green, add that to your config and you're done.
```yaml
pace_bms:
  protocol_commandset: 0x20
  protocol_version: 0x42 # the BMS is lying, so lie right back
  battery_chemistry: 0x4A # only if not 46
  protocol_variant: "EG4"
```
If you only got the yellow highlighted line, you're going to have to guess.  Try the following values and see which one gives you the most "correct" data: 
* PYLON
* SEPLOS
* EG4

The problem areas are going to be the last of the analog values such as Cycle Count, State of Charge and State of Health, and all of the status values.  If those don't make sense, or the BMS doesn't respond, it's the wrong protocol variant.  

Once you've figured out the proper protocol variant that returns sensible status values, just fill out your YAML with [the rest of the settings / readouts you want exposed](#Exposing-the-sensors-this-is-the-good-part) and you can skip the rest of this section. Please contact me with your make/model/hardware version as well as the settings you used so that I can add it to the known supported list.

If it didn't work
-
If none of the protocol variants work properly, or you have a different issue following these steps, I'd be interested to hear about it.  You may have a BMS speaking a protocol variant I haven't come across or found documentation for.  Please file an issue and provide me with whatever data you can, including make/model/hardware version (in particular the hardware version reported by pace_bms if you can get it to respond to that request, or from the manufacturer's recommended BMS software if not), and VERY_VERBOSE level logs.  Even better if you can provide me some COM port traces between the manufacturer's software and the BMS or even a protocol spec doc you found by googling your hardware.  I might be able to implement the new variant for you.


# Decoding the Status Values (but you probably don't want to)

No seriously, just use the text values I painstakingly decoded for you :)  This is under a separate heading for a reason.

Really? OK, well here's the thing.  They're completely different for every single protocol version and variant.  Which is why I consolidated them into something you can display and understand.  But you might have a specific use case that necessitates decoding those bit flags yourself, so I did painstakingly expose and document them all.  Lets go over them one by one.

This is going to be tedious, so I'll "cheat" a bit by sharing some raw enums from the code.

	};
```

The entry:
- `balancing_status_value`

Contains bitflags.  It is 16 bits wide.  One for each cell.  If the bit is set, it indicates that cell is currently balancing.  Cell 1 is the least significant bit.

The entry:
- `system_status_value`

Contains bitflags.  These flags indicate the current status of the BMS.  Possible values:

```C++
	enum StatusInformation_SystemFlags

		P2F_HighChargeTemperatureProtect2Bit = (1 << 0),
	};
```


The entry:
- `fault_status_value`

Contains bitflags.  These flags indicate the BMS is faulted, a more serious condition than a protection being enabled.  Generally this means the hardware has failed in some way.  Possible values:

# I'm having a problem using this component

Did you read this entire document?  If not, please do that first to make sure you understand how everything works.  You might be able to figure it out on your own!

If you still have an issue, or are seeing some "strange data" or log output, you can create an issue report. 

# Miscellaneous Notes
 
- My personal preference is for the [C# Style Guidelines](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/design-guidelines/) but the idea is to get this into ESPHome and [their guidelines](https://esphome.io/guides/contributing.html#codebase-standards) are different.  It's currently a bit of a mishmash until I can refactor over to ESPHome's style completely.

- Huge shout-out to https://github.com/syssi/esphome-seplos-bms who implemented an initial basic decode letting me know this was possible, and also compiled some documentation which was immensely useful.  Without which I might never have gotten started on, or been motivated to finish, this more complete implementation of the protocol.

# Helping Out

- I would like to make additions to the [known supported battery packs](#What-Battery-Packs-are-Supported) section.  If you have a pack that works, please share!

- If you can locate any new [documentation](https://github.com/nkinnan/esphome-pace-bms/tree/main/protocol_documentation) on the protocol, particularly for version 20 variants, or if you find a variation on version 25 (I'm not aware of any at this time), please let me know!

- Want to contribute more directly? Found a bug? Submit a PR! Could be helpful to discuss it with me first if it's non-trivial design change, or adding a new variant. 

- And of course, if you appreciate the work that went into this, you can always [buy me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/nkinnan) :)
